## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Refactored mode launcher: auto-discover modes from registry, deleted `src/modes/launcher.ts`
- `aegis config validate` command
- Replaced custom `validateBody()` with Zod schemas on all API endpoints
- Updated documentation for 15 modes, cleaned stale references
- Removed redundant `docs/tui-cheatsheet.txt`
- Multi-stage Dockerfile with `oven/bun:1-slim` production image, HEALTHCHECK, non-root user
- `docker-compose.yml` with named volume, env passthrough, and dashboard-dev profile (Vite HMR)
- `.dockerignore` with comprehensive exclusion rules
- **AES-256-GCM vault encryption**: `src/vault/crypto.ts` with key management (`AEGIS_VAULT_KEY` env var or auto-generated `~/.aegis/.vault-key`), auto-migration from legacy `vault.json`, no plaintext fallback
- **Structured logger** (`src/cli/logger.ts`): levels, JSON output in non-TTY, pretty-print in TTY, module-scoped instances, writes to stderr
- **Error boundaries** (`src/cli/guard.ts`): `registerErrorBoundaries()` for `unhandledRejection` + `uncaughtException`
- **Graceful shutdown** (`index.ts`): SIGINT/SIGTERM handlers with agent cleanup via `agentManager.destroy()`
- **Zod config validation** (`src/config.ts`): `validateConfig()` with field-level salvage on invalid config
- **API hardening** (`src/api/server.ts`): CORS with configurable origins, rate limiting (100/min), input validation, security headers
- **Unit test suites**:
  - `src/memory/test-memory-system.ts` — 33 tests: init, user profile CRUD, daily logs, auto memories, fact extraction, search, context building
  - `src/memory/test-vector.ts` — 21 tests: add, search, category, stats, remove, edge cases
  - `src/memory/test-session-store.ts` — 13 tests: CRUD, rename, export, agent traces
  - `src/agent/test-engine.ts` — 85 assertions: IPC handling, hooks, kill, routing, events, listing
- **Architecture documentation**: agent system, memory system, sandbox system deep-dives
- **Developer guides**: creating modes, tools, and agent types step-by-step
- **REST API reference**: all endpoints with examples, validation rules, error codes
- `CHANGELOG.md` and `SECURITY.md` files
- **Documentation site**: homepage, sidebar navigation, and frontmatter-based content structure

### Changed

- `src/vault/manager.ts` — vault serialized as encrypted blob (`vault.enc`), auto-migrates from legacy `vault.json`, removes stale plaintext
- `src/cli/commands/config.ts` — shows `vault.enc` path and "AES-256-GCM encrypted" in status
- `README.md` — added Docker usage section with build/run/compose commands and security notes
- `docker-compose.yml` — removed deprecated `version` field
- `package.json` — added docs scripts for the documentation site

## [2026-05-31]

### Added

- Sandbox system: `FilesystemSandbox`, `ProcessSandbox`, `DockerSandbox` implementations with common interface
- Computer use tool: screen interaction via `src/tools/computer.ts`
- Agent evaluation harness: `src/harness/` with reporter, runner, and test types
- Dashboard routes for MCP, Memory, Serve, Setup, Skills, Status with corresponding UI components
- AgentMemory sidecar integration: REST connector, smart-search fusion, CLI mode, mode registration
- Mode launcher: keyboard-navigable mode selection, MCP CLI, memory CLI, vector memory, type fixes
- Web tools: `web_fetch` and `web_search` tools
- MCP integration: stdio and HTTP server modes
- Shell mode: inline command execution in chat
- Checkpoint/rewind system in chat store
- Model picker UI: provider and model selection in chat
- Vector memory: 128-dim hash-based embeddings with cosine similarity search
- 13 agent types: build, plan, read, write, test, validate, review, debug, document, refactor, deploy, monitor, explore
- Session management actions: delete, rename, export with pendingAction confirmation flow
- CI/CD pipeline: GitHub Actions with setup-bun, dependency caching, typecheck before tests

### Fixed

- Corrected TypeScript type issues in ChatState.config — removed `any` casts in renderer and store
- Test exit codes, session persistence, slash command handling
- README formatting and clarity improvements
- Security: removed API key history from git

### Infrastructure

- GitHub Actions CI with matrix strategy (typecheck + test)
- PR templates for bug reports, feature requests, and changes
- PR description templates for security, session management, TUI tests, and type tightening
